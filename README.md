### Hi there üëã

My name is Plamen and I have been building open source software since 2018.

My journey in open source started as a software engineer for the [DAI-Lab](https://github.com/DAI-Lab), where I was challenged
with many interesting problems which lead me to improve all of my skills and expand my knowledge in both open source and software 
engineering.

#### üî≠ What do you do?
I'm currently working for [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com/), which is the proud developer of [SDV](https://github.com/sdv-dev), the 
largest ecosystem for synthetic data generation & evaluation. I'm developing new features, re-factoring and maintaining
parts of the projects whithin the ecosystem.

This are the main projects that I'm actively working on nowadays:

* [SDV](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV) - The Synthetic Data Vault is a Synthetic Data Generation that has the same format and statistical properties.
* [RDT](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT) - Reversible Data Transforms is a Python library that transforms raw data into fully numerical data.
* [CTGAN](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN) - A collection of Deep Learning based synthetic data generators for single table data.
* [Copulas](https://github.com/sdv-dev/Copulas) - A Python library for modeling multivariate distributions and sampling from them using copula functions.
* [DeepEcho](https://github.com/sdv-dev/DeepEcho) - A Synthetic Data Generation Python library for mixed-type, multivariate time series.
* [SDMetrics](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics) - Library that evaluates synthetic data by comparing it to the real data that you're trying to mimic.
* [SDGym](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDGym) - Synthetic Data Gym is a framework to benchmark the performance of synthetic data generators based on SDV and SDMetrics.


#### üèÜ Contributed

Here is a list of the public repositories that I contributed during the past years:

* [SteganoGAN](https://github.com/DAI-Lab/SteganoGAN) - A tool for creating steganographic images using adversarial training.
* [MLPrimitives](https://github.com/MLBazaar/MLPrimitives) - Pipelines and primitives for machine learning and data science.
* [MLBlocks](https://github.com/MLBazaar/MLBlocks) - A simple framework for composing end-to-end tunable Machine Learning Pipelines.
* [BTB](https://github.com/MLBazaar/BTB) - Bayesian Tuning and Bandits, a tool for hyper parameter tunning and selecting between models.
* [AutoBazaar](https://github.com/MLBazaar/AutoBazaar) - A AutoML system combining BTB, MLPrimitives and MLBlocks.
* [mit-d3m-ta2](https://github.com/MLBazaar/mit-d3m-ta2) - MIT-Featuretools TA2 submission for the D3M program.
* [ATM](https://github.com/HDI-Project/ATM) - Auto Tune Models is an AutoML system designed with ease of use in mind. 
* [Orion](https://github.com/sintel-dev/Orion) - A machine learning library for unsupervised time series anomaly detection.
* [SigPro](https://github.com/sintel-dev/SigPro) - An end-to-end solution to efficiently apply multiple signal processing techniques to convert raw time series into feature time series.
* [Draco](https://github.com/sintel-dev/Draco) - A collection of end-to-end solutions for machine learning problems commonly found in monitoring wind energy production systems.

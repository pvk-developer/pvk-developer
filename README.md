# Hey there! üëã

I'm Plamen, a passionate software engineer and open-source contributor since 2018.  

## üöÄ About Me

My journey in open source began at [DAI-Lab](https://github.com/DAI-Lab), where I tackled a variety of complex challenges that deepened my skills in software design, machine learning, and distributed systems. Since then, I've been actively contributing to open-source projects that aim to push the boundaries of data science, automation, machine learning and synthetic data generation.

## üë®‚Äçüíª What I‚Äôm Working On

I'm currently part of the awesome team at [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com/), the creators of [SDV](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV) ‚Äî the largest ecosystem for synthetic data generation and evaluation. My work spans feature development, code refactoring, and maintaining several open-source tools, including:

- [SDV](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV): The Synthetic Data Vault, a powerful synthetic data generation tool that maintains the same format and statistical properties as the real data.

- [RDT](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT): Reversible Data Transforms, a Python library for transforming raw data into fully numerical data.

- [CTGAN](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN): A collection of deep learning-based synthetic data generators for single table data.

- [Copulas](https://github.com/sdv-dev/Copulas): A Python library for modeling multivariate distributions and sampling from them using copula functions.

- [DeepEcho](https://github.com/sdv-dev/DeepEcho): A synthetic data generation Python library for mixed-type, multivariate time series.

- [SDMetrics](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDMetrics): A library that evaluates synthetic data by comparing it to the real data you're trying to mimic.

- [SDGym](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDGym): Synthetic Data Gym, a framework for benchmarking the performance of synthetic data generators based on SDV and SDMetrics.

## üèÜ Notable Contributions

Here are some of the other open-source projects I‚Äôve contributed to over the years:

- [SteganoGAN](https://github.com/DAI-Lab/SteganoGAN): A tool for creating steganographic images using adversarial training.

- [MLPrimitives](https://github.com/MLBazaar/MLPrimitives): Pipelines and primitives for machine learning and data science.

- [MLBlocks](https://github.com/MLBazaar/MLBlocks): A simple framework for composing end-to-end tunable machine learning pipelines.

- [BTB](https://github.com/MLBazaar/BTB): Bayesian Tuning and Bandits, a tool for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

- [AutoBazaar](https://github.com/MLBazaar/AutoBazaar): An AutoML system combining BTB, MLPrimitives, and MLBlocks.

- [mit-d3m-ta2](https://github.com/MLBazaar/mit-d3m-ta2): MIT-Featuretools TA2 submission for the D3M program.

- [ATM](https://github.com/HDI-Project/ATM): Auto Tune Models, an AutoML system designed with ease of use in mind.

- [Orion](https://github.com/sintel-dev/Orion): A machine learning library for unsupervised time series anomaly detection.

- [SigPro](https://github.com/sintel-dev/SigPro): An end-to-end solution for efficiently applying multiple signal processing techniques to raw time series data.

- [Draco](https://github.com/sintel-dev/Draco): A collection of end-to-end solutions for machine learning problems commonly found in monitoring wind energy production systems.
